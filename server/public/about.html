  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>
    This project looks into whether NBA's USA born players or international born players play better, according to statistics.
    I used data from the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba" target="_blank">NBA Data API</a> 
    to pull then classify the player's data by nationality. Finally, I visualized it using charts and tables.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stakeholders that this project targets are: NBA scouts, front office decision-makers like General Managers, sports analysts, and fans interested in player performance and trends.
